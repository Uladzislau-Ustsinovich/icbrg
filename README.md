# Icebrg Autocomplete Test

This is a test project for Icebrg's interview process. The goal of this project is to implement autocomplete functionality for a text input field, where users will see suggestions as they type, similar to the behavior of Google search. The backend for this autocomplete feature can be accessed through the following API:

**Backend API**: [https://icebrg.mehanik.me](https://icebrg.mehanik.me)

To use the autocomplete feature, you need to perform JWT authentication. You'll need to request a login and password from the user before they can access the autocomplete field.
